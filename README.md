# Portfolio Projects

## Description

Welcome! This repository is a collection of all the Python projects that I have completed. Whether the file is part of a larger project or a simple one page script, it will be located here! Here people can view and utilize pieces of code from my projects that they may find useful.

Each project folder has its own readme document detailing the project created.

## Types of Projects

- [Basic Projects](#basic-projects)
- [Reinforcement Learning](#reinforcement-learning) - _Coming soon!_

### Basic Projects

The `basic` folder is home to basic custom projects that I have created. These are primarily console run applications, where you can type in a few console commands to receive a specific output. These projects can be run within the relevant folder using the command `python3 main.py`.

You **MUST** have a minimum of Python 3.7 installed to be able to use the programs.
