# Portfolio Projects

## Description

Welcome! This repository is one of two locations containing a collection of selected projects that I have completed. It focuses on the code for each project, while the second location ([my website](https://acius.co.uk/portfolio/)) provides the details for their purpose and how they work.

## Types of Projects

All projects created can be run within their respective folders using the command `python main.py`, using a minimum of Python 3.8 to run the projects.

### Basic Projects

The `basic` folder is home to basic custom projects that I have created. These are primarily console run applications, where you can type in a few console commands to receive a specific output. The project list is as follows:

- [Conversion Exchanger](https://github.com/Achronus/Portfolio/tree/master/basic/conversion_exchanger)
- [CSV Editor](https://github.com/Achronus/Portfolio/tree/master/basic/csv_editor)
- [Data Extraction Tool](https://github.com/Achronus/Portfolio/tree/master/basic/data_extraction_tool)
- [Data Structures](https://github.com/Achronus/Portfolio/tree/master/basic/data_structures)
- [File Searcher](https://github.com/Achronus/Portfolio/tree/master/basic/file_searcher)
- [Shape Coordinate System](https://github.com/Achronus/Portfolio/tree/master/basic/shape_coordinate_system)

### Advanced Projects

The projects within this section focus on more advanced projects that involve a higher degree of complexity when compared to other project types. Some projects are stored in the `advanced` folder, and others are in their separate repository. The projects within this section are listed below:

- [Wild Edible Plant Classifier](https://github.com/Achronus/wep-classifier)

### Reinforcement Learning Projects

The `rl` folder is home to custom Reinforcement Learning (RL) projects that I have created. The projects vary in complexity and core the core concepts of different parts of RL. The projects within this folder are as follows:

- [Dynamic Programming: FrozenLake](https://github.com/Achronus/Portfolio/tree/master/rl/dynamic_programming)
- [Monte-Carlo Learning](https://github.com/Achronus/Portfolio/tree/master/rl/monte_carlo)
