# Regression Analysis

Regression Analysis is one of the fundamental techniques used in Supervised Learning and is essential in statistical modelling. It provides a reliable way of identifying the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

Within this project, we focus on analysing city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon. The data is stored within a CSV file called `car_data`, containing 406 data points and 9 variables. The variable list is as follows: `MPG`, `cylinders`, `displacement`, `horsepower`, `weight`, `acceleration`, `modelYear`, `origin`, and `carName`.

Using the MATLAB programming language, the implementation provides a statistical analysis of the data without the help of built-in functions.
