# Ciphers

This folder consists of 4 common ciphers: the Caesar cipher, Transposition cipher, Substitution cipher and Affine cipher. Each cipher has their own unique class, with functions for encrypting and decrypting and an example for each one.

In addition to this, some of the ciphers have an example of being brute-forced. NOTE: I do not recommend using these ciphers for securing confidential information, these were fun little projects for me to better understand basic ciphers.
