# Data Structures

The data structures within this folder are popular Python variants of common C#/C++ data structures. They use inheritance where possible to avoid duplication of similar code, where the parent classes are located within the `parent` folder. Each data structures has a core set functionality including: removing an item, adding an item, the size of the structure, finding/checking an item, and viewing the items within the structure.

The data structures within this folder are as follows:

- Binary Tree
- Heap
  - Min
  - Max
- Linked List
  - Circular
  - Doubly
  - Normal
- Stack
- Queue

Each data structure has its own corresponding file. For example: queue is stored within `queue.py` and circular linked list is sotred within `circular_linked_list.py`.
