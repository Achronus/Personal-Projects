# K-Means Clustering

K-Means Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that takes unlabelled data and puts it into distinct groups based on its similarities. The algorithm is one of the most commonly used for clustering and provides a great starting point to understand the theory and practice behind clustering algorithms. As such, the project focuses on creating the algorithm without the assistance of Python libraries.

It uses a dataset of 300 data points representing different dog breeds, specified through four distinct traits: `height`, `tail length`, `leg length`, and `nose circumference`. The project aims to create a K-Means Clustering algorithm that divides the dog breeds according to these four traits.
